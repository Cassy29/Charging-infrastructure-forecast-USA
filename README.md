Charging infrastructure demand based on temperature related electric vehicle range reduction and housing types in the US

Low carbon governmental policies are on the rise and the need to fight greenhouse gases and global warming has been garnering more attention. Over the last five years, America ranked next to China at the forefront of electric vehicle adoption. Zero
Emission policies have been implemented through state laws and there has been an effort made towards engaging individuals and businesses in switching to zeroemission vehicles. Authorities, along private and public companies, have deployed
major investments towards the charging infrastructure of new electric vehicles.

This research conducted an investigation to leverage the impacts on charging infrastructure demand. Our research focuses on electric range reduction due to climate conditions and housing characteristics in order to examine their impact on the
demand for charging stations. The impact of precise forecasts on infrastructure demand is that it will allow crucial insights for optimal location allocations, along with providing substantiation for city, county and state investments in electric vehicle infrastructure. 
A machine learning model is applied to investigate the correlation between variables and predict an optimal forecast in charging station demand. The results found that ridge regression and Ordinary Least Squares Regression have
suggested that there could be an impact on charging station demand if the electric vehicles face range reduction due to cold climate environments. The findings gained regarding the impact of climate-related electric vehicle range reductions is a valuable insight which can help governmental bodies and companies who invest in electric vehicle infrastructure to allocate charging station locations more efficiently. This could, in turn, nurture faster electric vehicle adoption in consumer and commercial sites, as the known issue of range anxiety could be minimized.
